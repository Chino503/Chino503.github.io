				<h3>Surprised?</h3>
				<p>
					Hello, Julie. After we finished talking last night. I couldn't sleep. Once again, that's your fault! Anyways, I'm not gonna write you anything on paper, sorry. I'm kind of writing it right now lol.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used to know you back when we were little kids, now we're really old. You have changed a lot, I've notice a lot of things about you. For example: you're really smart and I know there are other brillian people out there but what separates you from them is that you have great common sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have great sense of humor and I really like that. I love people who can make me laugh and people who I can be comfortable with, and you're one of them. I could keep going but I feel like I'm making you read too much so I'm going to stop here. If you'll like to hear more please let me know when I see you.
				</p>
